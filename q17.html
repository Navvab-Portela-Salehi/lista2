                Oh, ey<br>
                You don't know, babe<br>
                When you hold me<br>
                And kiss me slowly<br>
                It's the sweetest thing<br><br>
                And it don't change<br>
                If I had it my way<br>
                You would know that you are<br>
                You're the coffee that I need in the morning<br>
                You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring<br><br>
                Won't you give yourself to me<br>
                Give it all, oh<br><br>
                I just wanna see<br>
                I just wanna see how beautiful you are<br>
                You know that I see it<br><br>
                I know you're a star<br>
                Where you go I follow<br>
                No matter how far<br><br>
                If life is a movie<br>
                Oh you're the best part, oh oh oh<br>
                You're the best part, oh oh oh<br>
                Best part<br><br>
                It's the sunrise<br>
                And those brown eyes, yes<br>
                You're the one that I desire<br><br>
                When we wake up<br>
                And then we make love<br>
                It makes me feel so nice<br><br>
                You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert<br>
                You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts<br>
                You're the sunshine on my life<br><br>
                I just wanna see how beautiful you are<br>
                You know that I see it<br><br>
                I know you're a star<br>
                Where you go I follow<br>
                No matter how far<br><br>
                If life is a movie<br>
                Then you're the best part, oh oh oh<br>
                You're the best part, oh oh oh<br>
                Best part<br><br>
                If you love me won't you say something<br>
                If you love me won't you<br>
                Won't you<br><br>
